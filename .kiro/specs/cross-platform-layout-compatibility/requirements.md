# Requirements Document

## Introduction

このChrome拡張機能「SideEffect」は現在Ubuntu環境で開発されており、Windows環境で実行するとレイアウトが崩れる問題があります。この機能は、異なるOS間でのレイアウト一貫性を確保し、すべてのプラットフォームで同じユーザー体験を提供することを目的としています。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want the Chrome extension to display correctly with the same layout as Ubuntu, so that I can have a consistent user experience regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is loaded on Windows THEN the layout SHALL match the Ubuntu layout exactly
2. WHEN font rendering occurs on Windows THEN text SHALL be displayed with the same size and spacing as Ubuntu
3. WHEN scrollbars are displayed on Windows THEN they SHALL have consistent styling across platforms
4. WHEN CSS box model calculations are performed THEN they SHALL produce identical results on both platforms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement cross-platform CSS fixes, so that the extension works consistently across different operating systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is applied THEN platform-specific differences SHALL be normalized through CSS resets
2. WHEN font metrics differ between platforms THEN CSS SHALL compensate for these differences
3. WHEN scrollbar styling varies THEN custom scrollbar styles SHALL override system defaults
4. WHEN box-sizing calculations differ THEN explicit box-sizing rules SHALL ensure consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any platform, I want all UI elements to be properly aligned and sized, so that the interface looks professional and is easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL have consistent dimensions across platforms
2. WHEN text content is rendered THEN line heights and spacing SHALL be identical
3. WHEN containers are sized THEN padding and margins SHALL be consistent
4. WHEN responsive breakpoints are triggered THEN layout adjustments SHALL work uniformly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify cross-platform compatibility, so that I can ensure the extension works correctly on all supported platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing on Windows THEN all layout elements SHALL match reference screenshots from Ubuntu
2. WHEN measuring element dimensions THEN they SHALL be within 1px tolerance across platforms
3. WHEN checking font rendering THEN text SHALL be legible and properly sized on all platforms
4. WHEN validating scrolling behavior THEN it SHALL work smoothly on both platforms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintenance developer, I want well-documented cross-platform fixes, so that I can understand and maintain the compatibility code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-platform CSS is written THEN it SHALL be clearly commented with platform-specific explanations
2. WHEN compatibility fixes are implemented THEN they SHALL be grouped and labeled for easy identification
3. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL include cross-platform considerations from the start
4. WHEN debugging layout issues THEN platform-specific code SHALL be easily identifiable
